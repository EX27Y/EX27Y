I am interested in building a family company. Where we do together over Discord/Teamspeak Arts, Music , Websites,
Mining, and so on to create Projects like NFT's and like we  all put money all in the bag so we can be a real compounder
 A real rival to these big NFT & Market Top Tier's who aren't a family.
I am from Germany my english get's day to day better. So excuse my french.
You all understand me! We will build the biggest family! I dont like using the term community because we live in this big capitalistic communistic  world
So don't understand me wrong but lets take the red pill !

Cheers !
Nico
